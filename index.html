                 <p id="info">Pomeranians have a reputation as lapdogs, 
                    they were originally bred to herd animals and pull sleds.
                     Earlier versions of the Pomeranian breed weighed around 30 pounds. 
                     In the 1800s, they were bred to be smaller to be kept as companions rather than working dogs. 
                     Since then, they've only gotten smaller.</p>
